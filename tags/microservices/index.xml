      <description>In this post we will explore some basic concepts while working with a microservices architecture in a distributed application. If you are not very familiar with microservices and the motivation behind it, you should take a look at this series of posts from NGINX that gives a great introduction on the subject.
All the concepts are quite simple and although the autor had sugested a few things to get started I will take you through the construction of a simple microservices app that you could deploy anywhere.</description>
